*   üëÄ **Movable Status Indicator**: A draggable on-screen indicator always shows the app's current status (Idle, Listening, Thinking).
*   ‚ù§Ô∏è **Free & Open Source**: OpenSpeak is completely free and built by the community. No ads, no subscriptions.

Global hotkey capture on Windows sometimes needs Administrator rights. If your chosen hotkey is not detected, **run PowerShell / the `.exe` as Administrator** and try again.

### Troubleshooting
| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Hotkey not captured | Use a non-reserved combo (`Ctrl+Shift+S`, `F10`, etc.) or run as Admin |
| Mic not detected | Check Windows Privacy Settings ‚Üí Microphone |
| Local model download slow | Make sure you have at least 3 GB free disk & stable internet |
